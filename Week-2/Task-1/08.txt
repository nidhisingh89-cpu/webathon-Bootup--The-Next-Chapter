There are three type of loops in javascript

for loop = The for loop repeats a block of code a specific number of times. 
It contains initialization, condition, and increment/decrement in one line.

while loop = The while loop executes as long as the condition is true. It can be thought of as a repeating if statement. 

do while loop = The do-while loop is similar to while loop except it executes the code block at least once before checking the condition.
